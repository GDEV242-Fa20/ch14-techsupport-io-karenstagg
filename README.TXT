This project is discussed in chapters 5 and 12.

This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users software problems are recorded inside
an input text file and then TechSupport advice is prepared after reading this file.  

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)


This program uses a default input text file named input.txt and contains a recorded 
software problem conversation.
This file is required to run this program and can be modified accordingly to contain 
alternate software problem conversations for TechSupport analysis.

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.  The default input text file containing the software problem
conversation will be analyzed.


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.
